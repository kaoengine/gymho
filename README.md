# Overview 
kaofit gym is a recently opened local business that opened its doors in late 2017 at 101 Main Street, Kangaroo Point. As an up and coming small business, kaofit doesn’t have a dedicated web development team. Their current website was built using Wix, with elements embedded from Gym Master which is an external membership management system. Having spoken to Aaron and Georgio (the owners) and members of kaofit, the general consensus is that their website, and in particular their class booking system is clunky and painful to use. Another issue that was raised is that the embedded Gym Master elements are uncustomizable and don’t flow with the other website elements.
